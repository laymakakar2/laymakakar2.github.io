            <h1>IT Ethics</h1>
            <p>AI ethics in robots is a critical and evolving field that addresses the moral implications and responsibilities associated with the development, deployment, and use of robots powered by artificial intelligence. As robots become more integrated into our daily lives, ethical considerations become increasingly important.</p>
            <h2>Privacy</h2>
            <p>Robots, especially those with surveillance capabilities or those integrated into personal environments like homes, pose significant privacy concerns. Ensuring that they collect and handle data responsibly is important.</p>
            <h3>Bias and Fairness</h3>
            <p> AI systems can inherit biases present in their training data or algorithms. In robots, this can manifest in discriminatory behaviors or unequal treatment of individuals. Ensuring fairness and preventing bias in AI decision-making is a key ethical concern.</p>
